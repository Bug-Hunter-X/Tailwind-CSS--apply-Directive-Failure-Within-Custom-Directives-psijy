# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Failure Within Custom Directives

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive does not correctly apply styles when used within a custom directive in a React component (or similar framework).  This occurs due to the dynamic nature of the directive's execution within a JSX environment.

## Bug Description

The `@apply` directive, intended for applying pre-defined utility classes, malfunctions when placed inside a function responsible for rendering a custom component. Styles intended to be applied using `@apply` are often ignored or applied incorrectly, resulting in unexpected visual inconsistencies.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe that the background color of the inner element is not blue as expected, indicating that the `@apply` directive is not functioning properly.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` to see a potential fix.

## Potential Solution

The solution involves directly applying the CSS classes without using `@apply`. This ensures that the styles are correctly applied regardless of the rendering context.  The solution is included in `bugSolution.html`

## Additional Notes

This bug might be related to how the JSX compilation or virtual DOM updates handle `@apply`. The issue is more prominent in dynamic contexts and less visible in static cases.
